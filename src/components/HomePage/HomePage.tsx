            This is a geolocation and weather API fetching app with the
            implementation of Auth0 written in TypeScript using Vite React
            framework. Once you are logged in or signed up, you can see the
            current weather as well as a weather forecast for several days
            ahead. Navigation through pages is done whereby React Routes. Only
            Authenticated users have Authorisation to navigate to the weather
            content and contact me section. In addition, SASS and SASS modules
            were used for styling.

          I am sometimes a tricky CSS Grid with some of my children being

          media queries as I am a responsive chick.
